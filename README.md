This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run project

PWA works only in production mode. In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm run build`

Then serve the app somehow. For example

### `npm i serve -g`

### `serve -s build`

The app is now served locally. Default [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

--------

Development mode is useful for frontend development :) (You can't install pwa in development mode) 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
